Eu sou o Marcos, bacharel em Engenharia Química pela Universidade de Brasília (UnB). Eu estudei bastante sobre a área de cosméticos e meio ambiente durante a faculdade. Eu me graduei em Dezembro de 2021 e venho desenvolvendo cosméticos, produtos de limpeza e perfumes por hobby desde o começo 2019. 

I discovered the Data Science and Artificial Ingelligence fields in the middle of 2021 and immediately fell in love with it. I have been studying a lot of the field since then and joined a voluntary project with a company called [Softex](https://softex.br
). The project's name was "Popularizando a Inteligência Artificial" (Popularizing the Artificial Intelligence). The main goal of the project was to make videos about some AI subjects and teach them in a simple way, in which any person could understand, even with no prior technology background.

Recently, I have been focusing all my effort and free time into studying and building a consistent background in Data Science and Machine Learning by taking online courses, reading books, kaggle notebooks, medium posts, and joining some data science communities. I aim to get a job in the field as soon as possible.

#### Technologies I already know:
* R and RMarkdown 
* Azure ML 
* Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib...)
* SQL (Postgres and MySQL)
