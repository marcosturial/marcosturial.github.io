# About me

I am Marcos, a brazilian Chemical Engineer from Universidade de Brasília (UnB). I studied a lot about the cosmetics industry and environmental engineering while in college. I graduated at December 2021 and I have been developing some cosmetics, cleaning products and perfumes for hobby since 2019. 

I discovered the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence fields in the middle of 2021 and immediately fell in love with it. I have been studying a lot of the field since then and joined a voluntary project  willing to delve into the subject in a company called <a href="https://softex.br" target ="blank"> Softex </a>. The project's name was *"Popularizando a Inteligência Artificial"* and it's main goal was to create content and make videos about some AI subjects to teach them in a simple way, in which any person could understand, even with no prior technology background.

Recently, I have been focusing my effort and free time into studying and building a consistent background in Data Science and Machine Learning by taking online courses, reading books, kaggle notebooks, medium posts, and joining some data science communities. I aim to get a job in the field as soon as possible and evolve more every day.

#### Technologies I already know:
* R and RMarkdown 
* Azure ML 
* Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib...)
* SQL (Postgres and MySQL)
* Power BI

#### Tecnhologies I am studying 
* Py Spark
* Apache Hadoop
* TensorFlow

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
# Welcome
